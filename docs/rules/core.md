# Core rules

Core rules are based on [generally-applicable AIPs][]. They are enabled by
default, and **should** be enabled for most APIs. It is recommended that APIs
which do not want to follow certain AIPs within the core section disable those
rules individually, rather than disabling the core rules as a set.
