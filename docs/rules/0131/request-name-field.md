# Get methods: Name field

This rule enforces that all `Get` standard methods have a `string name` field
in the request message, as mandated in [AIP-131][].

## Details

This rule looks at any message matching `Get*Request` and complains if
the `name` field type is not `string`.

## Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```proto
// Incorrect.
message GetBookRequest {
  bytes name = 1;  // Field type should be `string`.
}
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```proto
// Correct.
message GetBookRequest {
  string name = 1;
}
```

## Disabling

If you need to violate this rule, use a leading comment above the field.
Remember to also include an [aip.dev/not-precedent][] comment explaining why.

```proto

message GetBookRequest {
  // (-- api-linter: core::0131::request-name-field=disabled
  //     aip.dev/not-precedent: This uses `bytes` for historical reasons. --)
  bytes name = 1;
}
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, place the comment at the
top of the file.
