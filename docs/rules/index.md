# Rule Documentation

Rules are divided into groups according to AIP block: each discrete block of
AIPs may have a group of rules. The generally-applicable AIPs are organized
into the "core" group of rules, and remaining blocks are grouped based on the
`scope` name provided to the block on [aip.dev][].
