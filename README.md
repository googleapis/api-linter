# Google API Linter

The API linter provides real-time checks for compliance with many of Google's
API standards, documented using [API Improvement Proposals][]. It operates on
API surfaces defined in [protocol buffers][].

It identifies common mistakes and inconsistencies in API surfaces:

```proto
// Incorrect.
message GetBookRequest {
  // This is wrong; it should be spelled `name`.
  string book = 1;
}
```

When able, it also offers a suggestion for the correct fix.
