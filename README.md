# Google API Linter

The API linter provides real-time checks for compliance with many of Google's
API standards, documented using [API Improvement Proposals][]. It operates on
API surfaces defined in [protocol buffers][].

It identifies common mistakes and inconsistencies in API surfaces:

```proto
// Incorrect.
message GetBookRequest {
  // This is wrong; it should be spelled `name`.
  string book = 1;
}
```

When able, it also offers a suggestion for the correct fix.

## Versioning

The Google API linter does **not** follow semantic versioning. Semantic
versioning is challenging for a tool like a linter because the addition or
correction of virtually any rule is "breaking" (in the sense that a file that
previously reported no problems may now do so).

Therefore, the version numbers refer to the linter's core interface. In
general:

- Releases with only documentation, chores, dependency upgrades, and/or
  bugfixes are patch releases.
- Releases with new rules (or potentially removed rules) are minor releases.
- Releases with core interface alterations are major releases. This could
  include changes to the internal Go interface or the CLI user interface.

**Note:** Releases that increment the Go version will be considered minor.

This is an attempt to follow the spirit of semantic versioning while still
being useful.
